issues where solved, poliastro 0.13 was raised, new features were applied and
of course, new issues and bugs appeared.

Unfortunately, it's time
to bid adieu to the summer and have a look on what has been accomplished so far.
The CZML Extractor
This was undoubtedly the main and most time-consuming part of the project. The extractor
allows users to easily conv &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/19/2019-08-19-czml-extractor-an-overview.md/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190819_1300_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hard reformat week</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190818_1530_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Reformat on poliastro.atmosphere
After implementing the COESA62 and COESA76 models in
#738 I was not completly
happy because of lots of data and coefficients at the beginning of each script.
Therefore and after asking Juanlu, it was finally decided to move all those
numbers to text files under the * &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/18/2019-08-16-hard-reformat-week/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190818_1530_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Atmospheric models and more!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1900_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks for this last period...
While checking the stability of the 0.13, GSOC continues and new bugs,
implementations, and others need to be solved for the 0.14. Most of them are
related to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New frame modeling, implementation, and testing.
New plotting capabilities, such us two attractors in the sam &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/01/2019-08-01-atmospheric-models-and-more/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1900_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ground track plotting and Ellipsoids</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1300_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The second evaluation period has come to the end and with the end of the
program drawing ever closer, I'm happy to announce that most work on
the additional deliverables has been complete!
CZML3
I've added polylines and points (along with myriad of other dependent
properties/types). These also mar &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/01/2019-08-01-ground-track-plotting-and-ellipsoids.md/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1300_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New propagators</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190716_0700_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;What are propagators and why do we care about them?
One of the most common problems in astrodynamics and orbital mechanics is that
we want to know where a body will be at a given position along its orbit for a
given time. It is possible to integrate by hard the two-body equation and then
apply some  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/07/16/2019-07-16-new-propagators/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190716_0700_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Moving forward with the Cesium application</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190715_1550_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like in the last couple of weeks I got to work a little in several aspects
of the project. While this didn't allow me to focus on a single feature, it allowed
me to make progress in various different areas.
Bug resolving and 2D mode
First and foremost, I got rid of a particularly frustrating  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/07/15/2019-07-15-moving-forward-with-the-cesium-application/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190715_1550_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Converting to CZML and next steps</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190630_0930_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;So the first phase of GSoC is over and with it, it's time to reflect what
has been achieved in the last couple of months.
CZML3
As I mentioned in the
last blogpost
this is a very useful library created by juanlu. After a
few patches, the library now supports most CZML properties and - as far as I c &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/30/2019-06-30-converting-to-czml-and-next-steps/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190630_0930_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting done for next release</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190629_0500_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.13 is getting closer
Version 0.13 is expected to be tagged in about a month. As any other release,
it includes new features such as a new method in the Orbit class called
change_attractor or the trail parameter in StaticOrbitPlotter. However,
this release will also include really important &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/29/2019-06-29-getting-done-for-next-release/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190629_0500_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Communication satellites and refactoring</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190613_1900_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication satellites and refactoring
Those couple of weeks were spent mainly on setting future milestones
and improving the quality of the code. In a way, Tom Cargill's famous
aphorism came to my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent
of the development time.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/13/2019-06-13-communication-satellites-and-refactoring/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190613_1900_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
